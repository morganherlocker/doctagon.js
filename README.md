A node.js tool for creating docs from simple markdown.


Use a simple document structure of files and folders. The text in the files is markdown. To compile the docs down to a simple html file, just use:

    doctagon magic -o magic_help.html

Here is a sample doctagon directory structure:

    +magic
        +1-intro
            1-welcome to hugwartz.rm
            2-finding a wand.rm
            3-hello muggles.rm
        +2-starting out
            1-simple spell.rm
            2-novice spell.rm
        +3-advanced.rm
            1-magic.rm
